          <p>
            Hello, I am James Donaldson a Graphic Designer student at Southern
            Regional College.
          </p>
          <p>
            My passion for branding and marketing is stronger than ever. My
            first serious endeavour into the creative industry was establishing
            my sustainable clothing brand, Puq Organic Apparel. I began
            screen-printing t-shirts in a shipping container-based workshop
            which I powered by engineering a cycle-powered generator from
            various electrical parts. I progressed to open Northern Irelandâ€™s
            first high street sustainable fashion shop just three years later.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, I am a better-rounded graphic designer, continually
            developing my professional skills by studying and undertaking a wide
            variety of client work. I have now worked creatively within fashion,
            entertainment, fitness, education, and trade. Within these
            industries I have produced a range of digital and print-based
            advertising comprising logos, brochures, posters, social media
            content and even a book.
